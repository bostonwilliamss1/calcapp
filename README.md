# Overview

This was my first experience with C++. I really wanted to focus on learning the basic syntax, and I thought that the calculator would a good way to practice. This calculator can do simple calculations, square roots, exponents, and trigonometric functions.

The purpose of this program was really for me to get comfortable with C++. This program would be very helpful when working on small math equations, but there are obviously a lot of different calculators out there. The main purpose of this program was for me to learn syntax and the basics of C++.

# Development Environment

I used CLion as the IDE. I attempted to use Visual Studio Code and I could get it to run but it didn't work really well, so I switched over to CLion and it worked so much better. 

I used C++ for this and the math library so I could use the trigonometric functions.

# Future Work

- If I had more time I would have tried to make a GUI along with the calculator.
- I would add more specific things that other calculators have such as pi, e, etc.
- I would have tried to add it to a file so that we could store the results and retrieve them in case you needed them again.
